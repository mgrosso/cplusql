libframe began in 1998 with some free evenings of Matt's. It subsequently saw
some a few major contributions, daily production usage and occasional
maintenance coding at Primary Knowledge and then later at LookSmart.

Primary developers (at the moment):
Matt Grosso <mgrosso@acm.org>
Deepak Jain <djain@looksmart.net>

Code contributions also came from:
Patrick O'Shaughnessey <poshaughnessey@pobox.com>  
Lance Ball <lball@alumni.southwestern.edu>

There are a few other folks from whom I need to garner the name/email they are
comfortable with using here.
